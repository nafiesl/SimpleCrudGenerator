[{"content":"About this package This package contains artisan make:crud commands to create a simple CRUD feature with test classes on our Laravel 5.5 (and later) application. This package is fairly simple, to boost test-driven development method on our laravel application.\nWith this package installed on local environment, we can use (e.g.) php artisan make:crud Vehicle command to generate some files :\n App\\Models\\Vehicle.php eloquent model xxx_create_vehicles_table.php migration file VehicleController.php index.blade.php and forms.blade.php view file in resources/views/vehicles directory resources/lang/vehicle.php lang file VehicleFactory.php model factory file VehiclePolicy.php model policy file in app/Policies directory ManageVehiclesTest.php feature test class in tests/Feature directory VehicleTest.php unit test class in tests/Unit/Models directory VehiclePolicyTest.php unit test class in tests/Unit/Policies directory  It will update some file :\n Update routes/web.php to add vehicles resource route Update app/providers/AuthServiceProvider.php to add Vehicle model Policy class in $policies property  It will also create this file if it not exists :\n resources/lang/app.php lang file if it not exists tests/BrowserKitTest.php base Feature TestCase class if it not exists  Main purpose The main purpose of this package is for faster Test-driven Development, it generates model CRUD scaffolds complete with Testing Classes which will use Laravel Browserkit Testing package and PHPUnit.\n","description":"This package contains artisan make:crud commands to create a simple CRUD feature with test classes on our Laravel application.","id":0,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"About this package","uri":"https://nafiesl.github.io/SimpleCrudGenerator/docs/about/"},{"content":"How to install For Laravel 8.x 1 2  # Get the package $ composer require luthfi/simple-crud-generator:^2.0   For Laravel 5.6 to 7.x 1 2  # Get the package $ composer require luthfi/simple-crud-generator:^1.0   For Laravel 5.5 To use this package on laravel 5.5, we need to add the package (with browserkit) within require-dev in composer.json file, like so :\n1 2 3 4 5  # Install required package for laravel/browser-kit-testing $ composer require symfony/css-selector:^3.0 # Get the package $ composer require luthfi/simple-crud-generator 1.2.* --dev   ","description":"Install the package with composer.","id":1,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"How to install","uri":"https://nafiesl.github.io/SimpleCrudGenerator/docs/how-to-install/"},{"content":"How to use Just type in terminal $ php artisan make:crud ModelName command, it will create simple Laravel CRUD files of given model name completed with tests.\nFor example we want to create CRUD for \u0026lsquo;App\\Models\\Vehicle\u0026rsquo; model.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18  $ php artisan make:crud-simple Vehicle Vehicle resource route generated on routes/web.php.
